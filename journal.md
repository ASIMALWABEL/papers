# Title
Measurement - model comparison of secondary organic aerosol over West Africa

# Introduction
Bloggs et al have researched into this area extensively but they haven't addressed question X (Bloggs et al 2012).
We present hear measurements which shed some light on question X.
We used an aerosol mass spectrometer to measure the chemical composition of aerosol particles (Allen et al 2004).

# Simulations
We ran an atmospheric model to simluate formation of aerosol particles.
