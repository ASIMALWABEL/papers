# Title
Measurement - model comparison of secondary organic aerosol over West Africa

# Introduction
Bloggs et al have researched into this area extensively but they haven't addressed question X (Bloggs et al 2012).
We present hear measurements which shed some light on question X.
We used an aerosol mass spectrometer to measure the chemical composition of aerosol particles (Allen et al 2004).

# Simulations
We ran an atmospheric model to simluate formation of aerosol particles.

# Instrumentation
The Aerosol Mass Spectrometer is described in Allen et al 2003.

# Conclusions
We have made great inroads into understanding the mechanism of particle formation, referred to as question X in the introduction.
As always, there are unanswered questions, for which we should definitely receive further funding.
